This trigger node allows you to receive updates in your [n8n](https://www.n8n.io) workflows when significant events happen in your PagerDuty account. For example, when an incident triggers, escalates or resolves. See the `Events Supported` support section below for a full list of events.

## How to install

### Community Nodes (Recommended)

For users on n8n v0.187+, your instance owner can install this node from [Community Nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/).

1. Go to **Settings > Community Nodes**.
2. Select **Install**.
3. Enter `n8n-nodes-pagerduty-trigger` in **Enter npm package name**.
4. Agree to the [risks](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/risks/) of using community nodes: select **I understand the risks of installing unverified code from a public source**.
5. Select **Install**.

After installing the node, you can use it like any other node. n8n displays the node in search results in the **Nodes** panel.

### Manual installation

To get started install the package in your n8n root directory:

`npm install n8n-nodes-pagerduty-trigger`


For Docker-based deployments, add the following line before the font installation command in your [n8n Dockerfile](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/docker/images/n8n/Dockerfile):


`RUN cd /usr/local/lib/node_modules/n8n && npm install n8n-nodes-pagerduty-trigger`

## Options

### Custom Headers

You can define optional headers that will be passed along with the payload to the destination URL. The header values are redacted in GET requests, but are not redacted on the webhook when delivered to trigger node. All header names must be unique.

When sending custom headers, the JSON for the event will have headers and query parameters will always included.

### Include Headers and Query Parameters

By default, you'll receive the event body as your JSON. You can choose whether to return the full details of the request, including headers and query parameters instead of only the body.
